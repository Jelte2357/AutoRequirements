# AutoRequirements
Gets the all the requirements from a python project (folder)

Just put the file somewhere and add it to path.
then run AutoRequirements in the folder of your choice
a requirements.txt will be generated.

This code is extremely horribly written, but I wanted to solve this problem programmatically, and not manually.
